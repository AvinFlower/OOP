During the course project, an information system for a concert agency was successfully developed, serving as a tool for managing all aspects of event organization. Technologies such as the C# programming language, Entity Framework ORM, and the PostgreSQL database management system were utilized in the development process.

Microsoft Visual Studio was the chosen development environment for creating the application, offering a comprehensive set of tools and resources that facilitated a more efficient software development process. The effective interaction with the database was ensured by the use of the Entity Framework Core library, providing a convenient means of working with the database.

The developed application provides essential functionality for the successful management of a concert agency, offering artists a tool for ordering and planning concerts.
